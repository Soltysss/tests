Skeleton for a packages repository hosted in Google Storage Bucket
(to have actual packages inside, you need to trigger build).

The template creates:
- Google Bucket, configured to serve static website
- Points ${var.hostname}.scalr-labs.net via CNAME record to the bucket
- Uploads GPG public keys for APT repository
- Set ACLs:
  * WRITE: Drone service account (drone-903@scalr-labs.scalr.com.iam.gserviceaccount.com)
  * READ: Public
